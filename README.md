# The study of `Functional Programming` With Typescript

## Project Overview  
This project aims to verify the concepts learned from the book "Understanding Functional Programming" using TypeScript. Through this process, we will deepen our understanding of functional programming principles by applying them in TypeScript.

This function demonstrates the use of the `fp-ts` library to practice functional programming in TypeScript.
